    <h1>My Opinion of Idaho</h1>
    
    <p> Hands down my favorite activity in all of idaho is to go skiing.And my home town ski resort Bogus Basin is amazing.But there are so many different fun activities. Like roaring springs and many hikes. Luckily Idaho has such beautiful nature hikes and trips outdoors are amazing. Idaho is definitley a amazing place which I love so very much, it is my home I wish Others would know and recognize the beauty of our mountains, lakes, rivers, and etc.</p>
